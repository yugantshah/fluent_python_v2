If you start a coroutine using the await keyword, it’s easy to get a value returned by it, it can be safely cancelled, and you have a clear site to catch exceptions. But coroutines are often started by the asynchronous framework, and that can make them as hard to monitor as threads or processes.\n",

In Python, classic coroutines are built from generator functions, and native coroutines are defined with async def. “Classic Coroutines” introduced the concept, and Chapter 21 covers the use of native coroutines. Python coroutines usually run within a single thread under the supervision of an event loop, also in the same thread. Asynchronous programming frameworks such as asyncio, Curio, or Trio provide an event loop and supporting libraries for nonblocking, coroutine-based I/O. Coroutines support cooperative multitasking: each coroutine must explicitly cede control with the yield or await keyword, so that another may proceed concurrently (but not in parallel). This means that any blocking code in a coroutine blocks the execution of the event loop and all other coroutines—in contrast with the preemptive multitasking supported by processes and threads. On the other hand, each coroutine consumes less resources than a thread or process doing the same job."
